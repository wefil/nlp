Ngrams

N-grams, which are sequences of words or letters, have a variety of applications in the field of natural language processing (NLP). Here are some of the common uses for ngrams:

Language Modeling: N-grams are a foundational element in statistical language models, which predict the likelihood of the next word in a sequence. This is crucial for tasks like machine translation and text generation.

Sentiment Analysis: By analyzing the sequence of words, n-grams can help determine the overall sentiment of a piece of text. This is useful for tasks like analyzing customer reviews or social media posts.

Text Classification: N-grams can be used to categorize text documents into different groups. For instance, emails can be classified as spam or not spam based on the presence of specific word combinations.

Spelling Correction: N-grams can be used to identify misspelled words by comparing them to sequences of words in a large corpus. This helps in suggesting corrections and improving the overall quality of text.

Machine Translation: N-grams are used to translate text from one language to another by considering the order and probability of word sequences in both languages.

Information Retrieval: N-grams can be employed to improve the accuracy of search engines by understanding the relationships between words and phrases in a query.

Text Mining: N-grams are a valuable tool for extracting meaningful patterns and insights from large amounts of textual data

BOW,Tf-IDF and Skipgram

Use BoW for initial exploration, document classification with smaller datasets, or when simplicity is crucial.
Use TF-IDF when you need to consider word importance within documents and across a corpus for tasks like document similarity and retrieval.
Use Skipgram or CBOW (Word2Vec) when capturing semantic relationships and word meaning is essential for advanced NLP tasks like machine translation, chatbots, and text analysis.


Keyword extraction 


Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging as features, you can follow these steps:
Data Preparation:
Gather a labeled dataset where each input sequence is annotated with keywords/key phrases.
Each input sequence should also be annotated with NER tags and POS tags.
Feature Extraction:
Extract features from the input sequences that include:
Tokens: Words or subwords in the input sequence.
NER tags: Named Entity Recognition tags assigned to each token.
POS tags: Part-of-Speech tags assigned to each token.
Other relevant features based on the specific task or domain.
Model Selection:
Choose a suitable machine learning or deep learning model for keyword/key phrase extraction.
Commonly used models include Conditional Random Fields (CRFs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Bidirectional LSTMs (Long Short-Term Memory networks), Transformers, etc.

Machine Translation

Importing Packages: This section imports necessary libraries such as NumPy, pandas, TensorFlow, Keras, and Matplotlib for data manipulation, modeling, and visualization.
Loading the Data - English and Tamil: It loads English and Tamil text data from files.
Text Pre-Processing: It preprocesses the loaded text data by removing punctuation and stripping unnecessary characters.
Tokenizer and Padding: It defines functions to tokenize and pad the text data, preparing it for input to the neural network model.
Model Building: It defines a neural network model architecture using Keras Sequential API. The model consists of an Embedding layer, an LSTM layer, and a Dense layer.
Training the Model: It trains the defined model using the preprocessed data, with specified hyperparameters such as batch size, number of epochs, and optimizer.
Loss Insights: It visualizes the training and validation loss over epochs to monitor model performance.
Evaluation and Inference: It evaluates the trained model's accuracy on the training data and performs inference on test data. Inference involves translating Tamil sentences into English using the trained model.
